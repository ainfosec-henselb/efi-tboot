Notes
###############################################################################

Most of the source code in here was taken from TBOOT 1.9.5. Quite a bit of it
did not need modification. The Diffs section tracks the bits that were
modified. The Issues section is rather sparse. Most outstanding issues, work
or things that need to be addressed are in TODOs in comment in the code.

Special Cases
###############################################################################

The following were put together bit by bit so changes are not tracked here:

tboot.c
txt.c

Several small string modules were merged into string.c:
strlen.c
strcmp.c
strncmp.c
strncpy.c
strtoul.c
index.c
memcmp.c

###############################################################################
Issues
###############################################################################

 - Had to initialize the cmdline to defaults otherwise the calls before loading
the cmdline were returning garbage.

 - Trying to init mwait was causing hangs on writemsr.
